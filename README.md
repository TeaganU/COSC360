Project description:
For our project, we chose option one, which was the community skill sharing platform. Outdoor sports require a multitude of unique skills necessary for staying safe and these skills can be challenging to acquire. Our website will allow users to connect with each other to share skills and expand their knowledge on a variety of outdoor skills, such as climbing, mountaineering, skiing, and much more. This skill sharing could be a message to answer a simple question or an in person adventure with other users, creating a strong community of like minded people.

Requirements:

The site will have three kinds of users:

Unregistered users, which are only able to explore community questions and their correlated answers, see user profiles, and browse the website using a search bar.

Registered users, which can create listings, have a username/password/profile picture, sign up for sessions, message other users, and comment on listings.

Admin users, which have access to an analytics dashboard for users, are able to monitor the activities of users on the site, and can provide punishment for users who do not follow the site rules.
